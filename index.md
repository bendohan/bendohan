## I'm a Geography student at Middlebury College and created this page as part of an OpenSource GIS course

I learned [QGIS tools such as model builders and execute SQL](QGIS.md)

My class also was [mapped water channels using DEM's in SAGA](SAGA.md)

We've also worked on an experiment to investigate [reproducibility in geographic research](Malcomb.md) 

I've also analyzed twitter data to [investigate whether Hurricane Dorian or Sharpiegate was more tweeted about](Twitter.md)

Click [here](PostGIS.md) to learn about using how I used PostGIS for Urban Resilience mapping, and check out [my leaflet map of road access in Dar es Salaam](dsmap/index.html)

Click [here](Academia.md) for my thoughts on academic articles

## A Portfolio of OpenSource GIS Work for OpenSource GISscience at Middlebury College


I learned [QGIS tools such as model builders and execute SQL](QGIS.md) .

My class [mapped water channels using DEM's in SAGA](SAGA.md).

I used [PostGIS for Urban Resilience mapping in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](PostGIS.md), and check out [my leaflet map of road access in Dar es Salaam](dsmap/index.html).

We've worked on an experiment to investigate [reproducibility in geographic research](Malcomb.md) .

And I've also analyzed twitter data to [investigate whether Hurricane Dorian or Sharpiegate was more tweeted about](Twitter.md).

I have also [reviewed academic articles](Academia.md)

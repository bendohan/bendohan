## A Portfolio of GIS and Cartography work from my time as a student at Middlebury College


I learned [QGIS tools such as model builders and execute SQL](QGIS.md) .

Using SAGA software, I [mapped water channels using DEM's](SAGA.md).

I used [PostGIS for Urban Resilience mapping in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](PostGIS.md), and check out [my leaflet map of road access in Dar es Salaam](dsmap/index.html).

With a class, I worked on an experiment to investigate [reproducibility in geographic research](Malcomb.md) .

And I've also analyzed twitter data to [investigate whether Hurricane Dorian or Sharpiegate was more tweeted about](Twitter.md).

I taught myself [some of the basic functionality of spdep in RStudio](final.md)

I have also [reviewed academic articles](Academia.md)

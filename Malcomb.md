## Reproducibility in Geographic Research
# Malcomb et al, (2014): Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi

The focus of this lab was to investigate reproducibility and replicability in geographic research. We looked specifically at one article that was attempting to quantify social vulnerbality in Malawi. We started off by looking for Malcomb's data, and found some of it, but not all of it. Malcomb used data from the Department of Health Surveys, UNEP GLobal Risk, and FEWSNet. Our professor was able to acquire the DHS data, but it you do need to apply to use it. The UNEP data is availible to anyone online, but Malcomb was not clear about which data sources he used, so we had to take an educated guess, and we were unable to find the FEWSNet data.

## SQL GIS and online mapping:
## An interactive urban resilience excercise

This excercise is based around using Opensource data and GIS to measure Urban Resiliency. We will use data from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which is one of the best mapped regions on OpenStreetMap. This is a massive dataset, and so we will need to pick and choose what data we want to use, then isolate that data.
